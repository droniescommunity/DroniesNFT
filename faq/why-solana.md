# üèù Why Solana?

Solana Labs is a client of Unfold. At the time SOL NFT ecosystem was super small when they start creating the Dronies and [@PeterDeltondo](https://twitter.com/PeterDeltondo) reach out to the co-founder of SOL[@rajgokal](https://twitter.com/rajgokal) in Slack originally just to understand Solana NFT benefits vs ETH.

[@rajgokal](https://twitter.com/rajgokal) and the team loved the project and start helping[@unfoldco](https://twitter.com/unfoldco) launch their project. They are in constant conversations on Slack and do meet-ups twice a week. Recently[@rajgokal](https://twitter.com/rajgokal) changed is his PFP to a Dronie with super dope ART
