# üîé Evidence

Welcome to the very exciting Evidence channel, where you can help uncover the mystery behind Dronies. üëÄ

Dronies are still very new to the world, and we aren't too sure what they are yet, or what they're capable of. The story behind Dronies and how they came to be known is being unraveled by us, the community, based on clues we are given every now and then.&#x20;

The Evidence channel is where community members discuss the clues and try to figure out what they mean and how they connect. This channel is essential to the development of the story and should be used in the sole purpose of solving the mystery. Every day we know a little more about Dronies, and we love to welcome new members; the more we are, the quicker we can solve the mystery!&#x20;

So how can you catch up with what‚Äôs been done and help? The very first step, and most important, is to read #The-Dossier. This is where the story starts, and where we come to encounter the main characters of the story. Then, it is recommended you follow the Twitter and Instagram profiles of the characters, where they sometimes give more evidence!&#x20;

Note that much is still theories and the line between fact and speculation can sometimes be vague. Trust in your own reasoning and keep a critical mindset when studying the intel gathered in the community-driven resources. Are you unsure if the presented evidence is fact or theory? Ask your fellow sleuths for the source and thought process!
