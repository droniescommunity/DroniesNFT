# Royalties

PETER(founder): "The legal team was walking us through it, little over my head, but the TLDR was "you'd be stupid to do this". So some projects give a royalty to anyone that holds the NFT. So let´s say all holders of a 10k collection get 20% of the community wallet from aftermarket sales. That could be $.05 a day, it could be $5, $50, w/e. That then is classified as a security, because the NFT is producing access to a dividend. Some projects are trying to skirt the issue by creating meme tokens that you earn if you hold. You have to say "this token is worthless and there´s zero purpose for it" but you know that people will go buy it and it'll become worth something (think any meme token like Shiba or Doge). Projects that do these mechanics and then REVOKE or take them away letter to comply for marketplace listings or remove for fear of SEC concerns, essentially fall apart because most don´t have the best art or teams, and so the only purpose to have it is for w/e really hype benefit like royalty is So royalty goes away, the project dies."
