# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

They talk about this on the streams a lot, from a talent and capabilities standpoint, there's little they can't successfully execute, will depend on the community desire for specific things

Card game, board game, metaverse space and experience, mobile game, desktop game, VR game, etc is TBD. They're intentionally leaving that flexible so that they can pivot based on whatÂ´s best for the brand/project and what the community really wants.

[@PeterDeltondo](https://twitter.com/PeterDeltondo) mention that they got some images to share soon from real generative tests. It seems that the community and the team are talking a lot about a possible TV series and probably that will be included on the roadmap, everyone is a big fan of [@arcaneshow](https://twitter.com/arcaneshow)
