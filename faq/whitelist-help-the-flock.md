**What doesn't exist in this community regarding Whitelist?** 📛

There's no leveling system, no invite schemes, no game schemes, so don't just spam messages to look active to get a whitelist. In general, the community is looking to reward our active members who are engaged and are trying to create value long term. \
\
The goal of Dronies is to be a top-notch project, and for that, we can't just depend on amazing creators but also on a strong community with a lot of talent and willingness to create true value.\
