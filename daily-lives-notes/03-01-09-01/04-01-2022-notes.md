|       | If you are EB, are you going to have access to Public sale                                     | That's is correct, but I will confirm if this is not changed, but it will be allowed for EB to participate in the Public sale as well Also update the wallet address will be possible                         |
| 6:45  | How would the lower body of the Dronie will look like?                                         | **On Dribble there should be a blueprint of concepts.

|       | Could other projects in the same wallet create a problem on Solana?                            | Solana team is working on improving this, even like bots getting the rarest ones.                                                                                                                             |
|       | What are your plans with Dronies? Mint 2 and keep only one?                                    | I really believe in the project, so I will mint as many as I can and try to pickup very good deals on the secondary market. Maybe sell one if the price goes up and recover some of the investment or so.     |
| 24:35 | **Can we have a tool/resource that has a bigger FAQ?**                                         | <p>That's why there is document in the press releases, so we are starting with that, but that's the idea.<br>Build a bigger FAQ</p>                                                                           |

|       | is there a cut off time for minting?                                                           | Minting should be instantaneous, the longest seen by Peter was 4-5 minutes. If there is too much traffic, it may be slower, but it should not take too long. We are still defining the EB timing for minting. |
| 32:10 | Do you think that the prices could tank after minting, for whatever reason, like bots and etc? | <p>It is not easy to say, but we are not aware of any exploits that could cause this kind of issue<br>Other things we saw are full Pre sale, but we don't agree much on that for now. </p>                    |
| 39:00 | **Will there be any incentive to hold Dronies?**                                               | **100% the plan and we will have confirmed later if there is no security issues.**                                                                                                                            |
